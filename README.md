# EMS React Frontend

This repository contains a split React/Vite frontend for the Election Monitoring System demo. It is a port of the single-file `index.html` into modular JSX components under `src/`.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Phani\Downloads\load_book.py\ems
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open the printed dev server URL in your browser.

Notes:
- The app uses `localStorage` as persistence. Existing data from the previous single-file demo in the browser may remain.
- To push to your GitHub repo, follow the git commands provided next (you need push access / credentials).
